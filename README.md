## Project Separation for Enhanced Security

The **admin dashboard** is separated from the **customer-facing website** to maximize security. By isolating the management functionalities, sensitive operations such as database control and user management are protected from unauthorized access.

- **Admin Dashboard:** Only accessible to admin users through a separate URL.
- **Customer Website:** A public-facing website where users can search and book flights.

This separation ensures that only authorized users can access and modify sensitive data.


## Features and Future Enhancements

### Current Features:
- Flight search, booking, and management.
- Admin dashboard with flight, destination, and user management.
- Secure user authentication and payment processing.

### Planned Features:
- Send newsletters to multiple emails simultaneously.
- Improve user interface for enhanced usability.
- Add analytics and reporting features to track flight bookings and revenue.
